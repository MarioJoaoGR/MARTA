    This is the base Register class. All default registers (fg, bg, ef, rs) are created from this class. You can use it to create your own custom registers.
    
    Attributes:
        renderfuncs (Renderfuncs): A dictionary containing rendering functions for various formats.
        is_muted (bool): Indicates whether the register is muted, meaning its formatting is disabled.
        eightbit_call (lambda): A lambda function to handle 8-bit color values.
        rgb_call (lambda): A lambda function to handle RGB color values.
    
    Methods:
        mute(): Sometimes it is useful to disable the formatting for a register-object. You can do so by invoking this method. When muted, all attributes that are instances of Style will be set to their default values.
